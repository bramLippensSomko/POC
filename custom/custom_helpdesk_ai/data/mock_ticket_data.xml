            <field name="description">The network printer (identified as PRN-EAST-3F, model HP LaserJet Pro M404dn) in the East Wing on the 3rd floor keeps jamming repeatedly. We've tried clearing the paper path following the on-screen instructions and checked the paper type, but the issue recurs after printing just 2-3 pages.
